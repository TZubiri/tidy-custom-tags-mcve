The files in the root directory are a sample webpage I'd write.

The files in the actualoutput directory contain the outputs of some tidy validation commands ran against the sample webpage.
The filenames are the command that was ran, and the contents correspond to the output (both stderr and stdout)

The expectedoutput directory contain the outputs that I'd expect if the proposal were to be implemented.
The expectedoutput contains some outputs that aren't present in the actualoutput folder, these are new features.
